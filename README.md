## Description

Collection of presentations created during my time at Newcastle University.

<!-- New subsection -->

### Navigation

All presentations are split into sections, which can, in turn, be split into subsections.

To navigate between sections, use the **arrow keys** or the **arrow buttons** on the bottom right corner of the screen.  
The **spacebar** can also be used to go to the next slide.  
The light up arrow buttons are indicate the available directions.

To go through every page without missing subsections, using the **page down** and **page up** keys is recommended.

To have an overview of the presentation, press the **esc** key or the **overview** button on the bottom right corner of the screen.

### Information

The slides are created using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), a framework for easily creating presentations using HTML or Markdown, like in this case.
They are hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be accessed through the links in the [Presentations](#presentations) section.
